# PlasticTrade
 a repo for the plastictrade paper with Biyan Paramayudha.

 We use R to draw graph and Stata to make a regression. all graph is at folder "fig". "trade.R" is used for plastic import figures. "investasi.R" is used to produce "investasi.png" file in "fig".

 We do not save our dataset in this repo and they are available upon request. Please email us if you need them. However, data we use for the regression is confident.
